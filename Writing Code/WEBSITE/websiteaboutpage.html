            <p>This website is show casing my design work from NCEA Level 3 2017. My brief was a campaign about encouraging people to spend less time on technology, in particular children teenagers and young adults. I chose a bold colour palette that is present throughout my work in order to catch the attention of those looking down at their screens constantly. I wanted to promote my campaign entirely avoiding digital marketing as my campaign was about spending less time on technology.</p>
            
            <p>This is the brief that I based my deisgn work on; </p>
            
            <p>The New Zealand Education Department in conjunction with the Health Department are concerned about the amount of time children, teenagers and young adults in this day and age are spending on Computer screens and in particular, hand-held devices. They plan to launch a campaign called ‘offline’ which will promote a controlled use of technology. The aim of the campaign is to encourage young people to spend at least three hours a day without their phones, computers, iPads and other devices. They wish to encourage sports, outdoor activities, and to further social interaction between peers. You are a freelance designer contacted to promote the campaign ‘offline’.</p>
